Dear __name__,

as part of the Dareed project I am working on I am required to test my work. Since we are experiencing some problems not due to Cleopa's work (but due to others' one) we need to test our work package more intensly.

That's why you, __name__, are receiving this email!

The whole testing process will take you about 5 minutes to be completed but I am begging you to first read the entire email message to avoid any time waste.
The software we are about to test works with Facebook so I have set up some Facebook testing accounts for you (no need to use your personal one -if you had one!).

But let's get down to the required steps:
- go to this link to access the platform __loginlink__
- login to the platform using the following credentials
  * "__username__" as username
  * "__password__" as password
- click on the Facebook share button on the right
- login to Facebook using the following credentials
  * "__fbemail__" as email
  * "__fbpassword__" as password
- go on with the sharing process (you can choose where to share it)
- from the platform, go to bill analysis section
- click on the "Add bill" button on the top left
- add a bill and go back to the bill analysis section
- choose a graph to share and click on the small blue Facebook button on the upper right of each graph box
- enter your custom sharing message and share the graph

If you want you can mess around and change this or that. If you have some comments or problems, please reply to this message or hit me at mmerola@cleopa.de.

Thank you very much for your help, Ich wünsche dir ein sehr produktiven Tag.

Matteo.
